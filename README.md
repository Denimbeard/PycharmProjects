## Programming Experiments and Lessons from Uni


## Motivation
This is maininly a historical archive for lessons and developments that are being built as part of my classwork through Goldsmiths University. 

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Python](https://www.python.org)

## Features
Horrible code to inspire anyone learning, and to help other classmates develop alongside me in class. 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


## How to use?
If you are taking classes with me, you've likely gotten this link somehow and can help by noting anything you see or want to compare.
